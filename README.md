## How it works

## Motivation

### Why?
The market lacks tools for testing the **design** of web applications.
The design testing is usually done manually and requires a lot of developers, designers and testers attention and effort.

### The main goal
The aim of this project is to allow web developers and web designers to cover their application with end-to-end design tests.
I'd like to enhance design testing of web applications by creating a library which supports multiple types of such tests and can be easily used by developers or even designers with no programming knowledge.
