## How to use

### Instalation

In your project directory simply run: \
`npm install --save-dev @mikeyzat12/detest`


### Configuration file

In your project root directory (where you have `package.json` file) create a `detest.yaml` file.

### Writing test case suites

To see the configuration file API and detailed guide how to write test cases, check out [how to use docs](./docs/how-to-use.md).

### Running detest

Firstly, add a `detest` script to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "detest": "detest"
  }
}
```

Then, you can evaluate your tests from the command line like: \
`npm run detest`.

It will run de-test tests with configuration from `detest.yaml` file by default. Nonetheless, you can easily choose another config file or use many other cli options ([more info here](./docs/how-to-use.md#cli-options)).

## Examples

Check out the [Example React application project](https://github.com/MikeyZat/detest-example) for a complex example, including integrating the **de-test** into CI pipeline.

## How it works

## Motivation

### Why?
The market lacks tools for testing the **design** of web applications.
The design testing is usually done manually and requires a lot of developers, designers and testers attention and effort.

### The main goal
The aim of this project is to allow web developers and web designers to cover their application with end-to-end design tests.
I'd like to enhance design testing of web applications by creating a library which supports multiple types of such tests and can be easily used by developers or even designers with no programming knowledge.
